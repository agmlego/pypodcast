# pypodcast
## Goals
* takes in multiple RSS feeds and periodically scans them, fetching any new episodes
* downloads episodes as audio tracks, stuffing all available metadata into the file tags (podcast series, hosts/guests, episode number and title, shownotes, episode art, etc.)
* maintains the archive of files in a sensible directory structure (<podcast>/<season?>/<episode #> - <episode title>)
* handles feeds that have multiple series in them
